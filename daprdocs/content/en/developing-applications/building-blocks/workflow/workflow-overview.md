With workflows, you can orchestrate tasks or business logic within your application, making them reliable and restartable. Workflows provide a programming model for authoring code that abstracts away the complexities of messaging, state management, and failure handling.

## Workflow building block

The workflow building block:

- Provides a workflow API for running workflows
- An built-in workflow runtime to write Dapr workflows (of type workflow.dapr)
- Integrates with various workflow runtimes as components, for example Temporal workflows.

*To Do:*
- *Add diagram of how workflow API works?*
- *Add explaination of how the API works*
- *[Reference](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/service-invocation/service-invocation-overview/)*

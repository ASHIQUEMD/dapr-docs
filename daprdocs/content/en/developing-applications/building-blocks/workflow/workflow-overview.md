With Dapr workflows, you can automate and orchestrate tasks within your application. The workflow feature provides a developer-friendly programming model for authoring workflows as code in a way that abstracts away the complexities of messaging, state management, and failure handling.

The workflow feature is comprised of the Workflow API and the workflow components that allow for authoring workflows naitively in Dapr or through external 3rd party workflow applications.
